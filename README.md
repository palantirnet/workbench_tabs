# Workbench Tabs

A module to provide local task tabs and messages as part of the Toolbar, so that custom themes don't need to provide these administrative elements.

## Configuration

* Enable the module
* Optionally disable the primary and secondary tabs blocks for the admin theme, so that there are not duplicate task tabs on admin pages
